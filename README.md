## Project Title: Tax Code Example


### Description
This project is for coding your taxes in Iowa for 2023. When running this code you can input your income, if you are filing jointly and then your partner's income if so. It will then output your state tax, federal tax, and total tax for the year. It is a very useful program for someone who knows their salary for the year.
